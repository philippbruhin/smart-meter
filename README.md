# Electrical power consumption measurement and visualization

This repo serves as documentation for the [volkszaehler.org](https://github.com/volkszaehler/volkszaehler.org) project, which I am using to measure and visualize the electrical consumption of my home (heat pump, oven, washing machine, dryer etc.).

## Hardware

* **IR-Read-Write-Head** with TTL interface that I purchased as a kit with a pre-assembled circuit board from [Hichi]( https://www.photovoltaikforum.com/thread/141332-neue-lesekopf-baus%C3%A4tze-ohne-smd-l%C3%B6ten/).
* **Raspberry PI 4** with 32 GB SD card and image from [wiki.volkszaehler.org/howto/raspberry_pi_image](https://wiki.volkszaehler.org/howto/raspberry_pi_image).
* **Siemens TD-3511 smart meter** which has been installed by [EW Wangen SZ]( https://www.ewwangensz.ch/), what is the power supply company in the area where I live.
